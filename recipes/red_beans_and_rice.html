        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the dry red beans overnight. Cover it with water and soak for at least 6 hours. For best results, soak them overnight.</li>
            <li>In a skillet, heat oil. Add the onions, bell peppersm celery abd garlic. Should take about 3-4 min.</li>
            <li>Rinse the beans that were soaking , and transfer to a large pot with about 6 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked vegetables in the pot with the beans. Season with bay leaves, parsley, thyme, cayenne pepper, sage and the cajun seasoning. Bring this to a boil and reduce heat to medium - low and let simmer. Simmer for about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>After it has simmered for about 2 1/2 hours, add the cut up sausage to the beans and again simmer for 30 min.</li>
            <li>While that is simmering, in another saucepan, add water and rice. Once it is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer for about 20 min or until rice is tender and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Serve the beans over steamed white rice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
