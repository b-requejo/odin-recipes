Project - The Odin Project - recipes
This is the first student project for the Odin Project. 
The aim with this project is to be able to demonstrate what we have learned thus far. This includes:
    * Successfully creating a repository in github
    * Cloning that repository onto the local machine
    * Successfully create a basic HTML document
        * use the listed and unlisted tags
        * Create and embed an image
        * Embed a url link using either a relative link or an absolute link.
    * Use the CLI to stage the code, commit the code and push the html codes.
